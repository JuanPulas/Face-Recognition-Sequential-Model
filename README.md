# Face-Recognition-Sequential-Model
This script has a Face Recognition algorithm created with TensoFlow and the Keras API; using the Sequential model.

This model was trained on the Labled Faces in the Wild face dataset. It uses a Neural Network with 3 convolutional layers with ELU activation and a Softmax activation in the output layer.
